# orcaslicer-configs

Various OrcaSlicer configs for different filaments. Used on my BmabuLab P1P.

Note that my P1P is partially enclosed with the ever-glorious [Companion Cube Mod](https://www.printables.com/model/342914-companion-cube-p1p-mod-bambu-lab). If you're reusing any of these, you may need slight adjustment based on your setup.
